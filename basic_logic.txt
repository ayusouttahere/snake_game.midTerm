we making this in c plus plus. 

we'll have a problem to print at random coordinates...


Storing coordinates inside structures...
like : 
struct co-ordinate{
    int x  ;
    int y ; 
}

and we will make a class snake.
class snake int{
    int length ; 
    char direction ; // 4 direction. left, right, down, up ; 

}

anothter class board{
    class snake{

    }
    class scoreP{

    }
    class lean{

    }
    class point{

    }
}

there will only be 2 direction available to move... as...
